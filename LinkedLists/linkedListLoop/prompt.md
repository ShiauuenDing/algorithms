# Find Loop

## [Solution (JS)](./solution.js) / [Solution (Go)](./solution.go)

Write a function that takes in the head of a singly linked list that contains a loop and returns the node from which the loop originates.
Every node has a value and a next property.

```
Sample Input:
n0 -> n1 -> n2 -> n3 -> n4 -> n5
            ^     v
            n8 <- n7
Sample Output:
n4
```
