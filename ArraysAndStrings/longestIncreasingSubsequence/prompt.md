# Longest Increasing Subsequence

Given an array of integers, write a function that returns the longest strictly-increasing subsequence in that array. A subsequence is defined as a set of numbers that aren't necessarily adjacent but are in the same order they appear in the array. Assume there will only be one longest increasing subsequence.

```
Sample Input: [6, 7, -24, 12, 15, -12, 12, 5, 4, 35, 9]
Sample Output: [ 6, 7, 12, 15, 35 ]
```
